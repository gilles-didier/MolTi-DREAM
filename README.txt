Directory "src" contains the C source code of the softwares used for the community detection, graph and partition pre- and post-filtering and formats translation. "make all" build all of them.

Directory "script" contains the bash scripts that perform the (re-)clustering of the communities larger than a given size threshold. They generally have to be applied recursively.

Each directory contains a README.txt file presenting how to use scripts and software in details.
